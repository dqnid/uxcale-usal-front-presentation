# USAL Presentation

Base project to serve as a simple introduction to web technologies in general, and React in particular.

## Getting ready

0. Get Node.js and npm

- On Windows or Mac click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- On Linux use your package manager:
  - Arch based distros: `$ sudo pacman -S nodejs npm`
  - Debian based distros (ubuntu, PopOs, etc.): `$ sudo apt install nodejs npm`

You will know you got it right if the following commands give you an output:

- `$ node -v`
- `$ npm -v`

1. Copy the repository on your local machine, that will be done using git.

- `$ git clone https://github.com/dqnid/uxcale-usal-front-presentation.git`

2. Navigate to the repository's code on the terminal

- `$ cd uxcale-usal-front-presentation/code`

3. Install the required packages using either yarn or npm

- `$ npm i`

or

- `$ yarn i`

## Actually running

While being on the base directory of your project (`code/`), we can run the basic project using Node.js through npm:

- `$ npm run start:dev`

Then go to your preferred browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`
